Folder used to store VS code settings and keybindings configuration files.

By default VS Code shows the Settings editor, but you can still edit the
underlying settings.json file by using the Open Settings (JSON) command or by
changing your default settings editor with the workbench.settings.editor
setting.

Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:

* Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
* macOS $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
* Linux $HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json
