" Add shortcut "<leader>-d" to delete the contents of the line, without
" deleting the line itself
nnoremap <leader>d 0<S-d>

" nice way to close the current buffer
nnoremap <leader>x :bp\|bd #<CR>

" Set shortcut to close all other buffers except the current one.
" If any buffers have local changes that have not been saved, they will be
" left open.
nnoremap <leader><S-x> :%bd <bar> :e# <bar> :bNext <bar> :bdelete<cr>

" Add shortcut "<leader>o" and "<leader>O" to insert new lines below and above
" without leaving normal mode
nnoremap <leader>o o<ESC>
nnoremap <leader><s-o> <s-o><ESC>

" Add shortcut "<leader>-p" to change the current word with the current yanked text
nnoremap <leader>p "_cw<C-r>"<ESC>

" map leader-h and leader-l to move to previous older and newer quickfix views.
autocmd BufReadPost quickfix nnoremap <buffer> <leader>h :col<CR>

" add shortcut to quickly open vimrc:

" use leader key to navigate up and down across _displayed_ lines (when lines
" are wrapped), rather than jumping to the next actual line:

" use leader key to enable and disable line wrapping:
